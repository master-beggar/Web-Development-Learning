                    Hello everyone! My name is Walid Naimi and I will be your guide.
                    Browser-sync is an awesome tool for website development.
                    I don't have to do much to get this to work properly.
                    Browser Sync is pretty awesome if you ask me. It doesn't make too
                    much sense the other way around. I like this thing. It makes this
                    so much faster to work with.
                </p>

                    This here is the sidebar. It is what you are going to use for the next
                    eternity.
